########## Original Pet Chooser: Creating a Pets Class using different inputs and values
                      # 1. Start
                      # 2. Connect to your personal (pets) database
                      # 3. Read data
                      # 4. Create one (object) instance of a Pets class for each pet listed in your database.
                      #     Keep your Pets class in a separate file
                      # 5. Display a list of pet names, from the pet object instances
                      # 6. Ask the user to choose a pet
                      # 7. Once a pet is chosen, print that pet's info from the (object) instance.
# Upgrade Pet Chooser ###############################################################
# (a) Clone your Pet Chooser program to a new PyCharm project.
#     At every menu, allow the user to use Q or q to quit your program nicely.
# (b) Initial View: When the program begins, list all of the pets like before, and ask the user to choose a pet.
#     Once a pet is chosen, print out the same information as before.
# (c) Options: When the pet's information has been displayed, ask the user if they would like to continue or edit the pet's information.
#     Display the chosen petâ€™s information and ask whether like to [C]ontinue, [Q]uit, or [E]dit this pet?
#     Choosing to quit (by typing Q + [ENTER]), quit the program nicely.
#     Choosing to continue (by typing C + [ENTER]), display the list of pets again from the Initial View.
#     Choosing to edit (by typing E + [ENTER]), display the Edit Process below.
# (d) Edit Process: Ask the user which pet to edit (a number from the Initial View list), step through the pet's name and age to ask the user to provide an update.
#     Updating that pet's name in the database.  Display a message indicating the pet's name has
#     Updating that pet's age in the database.  Display a message indicating the pet's age has been updated.
# When the updates are complete, display the list of pets again from the Initial View.
